Dear cBioPortal User,

The cBioPortal code has been moved to bitbucket and remains free for academic use.

Due to both an increase in demand for the cBio Portal software and to better manage distribution and support for those users that choose to run their own local instances of it, we have decided to move the cBioPortal software repository from Google Code to Bitbucket.  While access to the software on Bitbucket will be restricted, it is not our intent to discourage the downloading or use of it.

The cBioPortal software will be distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License for academic and commercial usage with a few stipulations.  First, we ask that you be willing to **provide constructive feedback** on the features & functionality of the software as it evolves.  Second, we ask that **any modifications to the software be made available** to us for integration back into the codebase as per the LGPL.  Third, we request that when your data becomes publicly available you provide it to us for **integration into our database**, in order to make it available to the greater research community.  Finally, we require that a statement of origin and link to the cbioPortal running @MSKCC be present on the home page any running instance of the portal.

If you are interested in downloading the cBioPortal source code or would like to set up a local instance of the software, please contact us directly at:

cbioportal@cbio.mskcc.org
